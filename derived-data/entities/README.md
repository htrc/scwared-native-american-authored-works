This directory contains the entities (or “named entities”) for 906 volumes of predominantly English-language fiction authored by Native Americans and First Nations authors, as identified by Dr. Raina Heaton, Dr. Kun Lu, and Dr. Raymond I. Orr. Titles were sourced from the Native American Authors collection provided by the Internet Public Library (https://www.ipl.org/div/natam/) and The Native American Languages (NAL) collection at the Sam Noble Museum at Oklahoma University, of which Dr. Heaton is Associate Curator. 

The entities are available as two zip archives:

- `history-of-black-writing-entities.zip` contains a single `.csv` file containing all the entities for all 1997 volumes.
- `history-of-black-writing-entities-by-volume.zip` includes the same data as a separate `.csv` file for each of the 1997 volumes.

The entities were extracted using the open-source [spaCy](https://spacy.io) Natural Language Processing (NLP) library. Please see the spaCy [documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features/#named-entities) for more details about the data found in the `.csv` files.
